#Assignment Instructions
#Stores the sum of grades for each student in an associative array.
#Calculates the average grade for each student and classifies them as Pass (average â‰¥ 70) or Fail. (Must use a user-defined function to calculate the average.)
#Determine the highest and lowest scoring students (total score)
#Print the following for each student at the end
#Student name
#Total score
#Average score
#Status (pass/fail)
#Also, print the top and lowest scoring students#
